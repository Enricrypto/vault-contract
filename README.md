Requirements Recap:
1) Use ERC-4626 as the base vault structure (OpenZeppelin’s implementation).✅
2) Override the deposit, withdraw, and totalAssets functions to interact with Aave’s ETHx market. ✅
3) The vault should handle ETH wrapping (since ETH needs to be wrapped into WETH for Aave).✅
4) Interact with Aave's Pool contract to deposit and withdraw assets. ✅
